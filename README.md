# Info

This is just a small script to help out with collecting data from [Gensh.in](https://www.gensh.in/) and parsing it. This script helps with adding new items faster to the GWS Database that Kumiko uses. The script scrapes each page of an character or weapon, and takes the the name of the character/weapon, the star rank, and the description.
